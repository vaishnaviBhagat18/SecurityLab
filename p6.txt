6.Explain and show the execution of basic network commands with different
options for each commands:
ifconfig, ping, netstat, Whois, dig, nslookup, traceroute, host,arp, hostname

Software: Ubuntu 20. 0 4 LTS

Sudo apt install net-tools

1. ifconfig :
Linux ifconfig stands for interface configurator. It is one of the most basic commands used in network inspection. ifconfig is used 
to initialize an interface, configure it with an IP address, and enable or disable it. It is also used to display the route and the network interface.
Basic information displayed upon using ifconfig are:
1. IP address
2. MAC address
3. MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit)
To get all the details using ifconfig
Ifconfig
Using this command, you can get details of a specific interface. This is shown below.
Commands:
ifconfig eno1
ifconfig lo

ip command:
The ip addr command without any subcommands shows the network interface
information, including the associated IP addresses:
Syntax:
ip addr

ip -4 addr (IP Command is used to show network interface information)
ip -6 addr  To set the size of MTU
By default, MTU has a size of 1500. This can be however set externally by the user using
ifconfig.
Syntax: Ifconfig eno1 mtu xxxx

2. Netstat:
netstat(Network Statistics) is the command that is used to display routing table,
connection information, the status of ports. i.e. it gives details information about
network activity on Linux System.
a. netstat -r Using -r flag will display the routing table
b. netstat –a use -a flag to show listening and non-listening sockets(TCP+ UDP)
c. netstat –at to show all TCP socket
d. netstat –l to show all active ports
e. netstat –u to show all UDP socket

3 .Whois
The whois command displays information about a website's record. You may get all the
information about a website regarding its registration and owner's information.
Syntax:
whois <websiteName>
Example:
whois javatpoint.com
4.dig
dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about
DNS name servers. It is basically used by network administrators. It is used for verifying and
troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups.
Syntax:

dig [server] [name] [type]

dig geeksforgeeks.org

5.ping :
Ping (Packet Internet Groper) command is the best way to test connectivity
between two nodes. Whether it is Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area
Network (WAN).
the ping command is used to ensure that a computer can communicate to a specified
device over the network. The pings command sends Internet Control Message
Protocol(ICMP) Echo Request messages in the form of packets to the destination
computer and waits in order to get the response back. Once the packets are received
by the destined computer, it starts sending the packets back. This command keeps
executing until it si interrupted.
Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to communicate to other
devices.
ping command provides details such as:  number of packets transmitted
number of packets received
time taken by the packet to return
ping command in generally used for the following purposes:  measuring the time taken by the packets to return to determine the speed of the
connection
to make sure that the network connection between the host and the destined
computer can be established
Example:  ping google.com
ping 216.58.203.142
6. traceroute :
This utility uses the ICMP protocol and finds the hops involved in reading the destination
server. It also shows the time it takes between hops. This command is used to get the route
of a packet. i.e. to determine the path along which a packet travels. It also returns the
number of hops taken by the packet to reach the destination. This command prints to the
console, a list of hosts through which the packet travels in order to the destination.
Example:
traceroute www.google.com
traceroute 4.2.2.2

-4 Option: Use ip version 4 i.e. use IPv4
Syntax:
traceroute -4 google.com
-4 Option: Use ip version 6 i.e. use IPv6
Syntax:
traceroute -6 google.com

7. nslookup:
nslookup command queries the DNS in order to fetch the IP address or the domain
name from DNS records.
Example:
nslookup www.facebook.com
8. route:
route command also shows and manipulates the ip routing table
To see the default routing table in Linux, type the following command.
# route

9. host:
host command is used to find a domain name associated with the IP address or find an
IP address associated with the domain name. The returned IP address is either IPv4 or
IPv6.
Example:
host www.google.com
host 31.13.78.35

10. hostname To check and set the hostname of the server.
Example:
hostname
11. arp:
ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) command is used to display and modify
ARP cache, which contains the mapping of IP address to MAC address.

The system’s TCP/IP stack uses ARP in order to determine the MAC
address associated with an IP address.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is useful to view/add the contents of the
kernel’s ARP tables. To see the default table use the command as.
# arp -e
