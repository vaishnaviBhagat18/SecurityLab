7.Download and install Nmap. Use it with different options to scan open ports,perform OS, fingerprinting, do a ping scan, tcp port scan, udp port scan

1. How to Install Nmap
On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap -y OR sudo apt-get install nmap
2. For version detection:
nmap -sV <target-host's URL or IP>
3. To scan a System with Hostname and IP address. First, Scan using Hostname
nmap www.geeksforgeeks.org
Now let’s Scan using IP Address
nmap 172.217.27.174
4. To scan using “-v” option: It is used to get more detailed information about the
remote machines. nmap -v www.geeksforgeeks.org
5.To scan multiple hosts: We can scan multiple hosts by writing IP addresses or
hostnames with nmap. nmap 103.76.228.244 157.240.198.35 172.217.27.174
6.To scan whole subnet: We can scan a whole subnet or IP range with nmap by
providing “*” with it. It will scan a whole subnet and give the information about
those hosts which are Up in the Network. nmap 103.76.228.*
7.To scan specific range of IP address: We can specify the range of IP addresses. This command will scan IP address 192.168.29.1 to 192.168.29.20 . nmap 192.168.29.1-20

8.To scan to detect firewall settings: Detecting firewall settings can be useful
during penetration testing and vulnerability scans. To detect it we use “-sA” option. This will provide you with information about firewall being active on the host. It
uses an ACK scan to receive the information. sudo nmap -sA 103.76.228.244
9.Here -sS flag is used for TCP SYN Scan, Which is a stealthy and efficient
method of scanning for open ports on a target system. sudo nmap -sS <Domain Name>
10. The “-sn” flag is used with nmap to perform a ping scan, which sends
ICMP requests to a target host or network to determine hosts is up or not. This checks which devices are alive in the network without scanning ports. nmap -sn <Domain Name>
sudo nmap -sU <domain Name> ----> (UDP)
11.The “-p” flag is used with nmap to perform scan on a specific port or
range of ports. ( In our case it will scan port 80,443 and 21 )
nmap -p 80 443 21 <Domain Name>
12.We can also specify the range of ports to scan on a network. ( In this case it
will scan all the ports in the range of 1 to 80 )
nmap -p 1-80 <Domain Name>
13.Here -A indicates aggressive, it will give us extra information, like OS
detection (-O), version detection, script scanning (-sC), and traceroute (–
traceroute). It even provides a lot of valuable information about the host. nmap -A <Domain Name>
14.Using this command we can discover the target hosting service or identify
additional targets according to our needs for quickly tracing the path. nmap --trace out <Domain Name>
15. Here it will display the operating system sudo nmap -O <Domain Name>
